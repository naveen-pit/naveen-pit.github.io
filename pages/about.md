# **About Me**

Hello! I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
a passionate data scientist with a diverse background in finance and technology. Over the past years, I've had the opportunity to work on impactful projects across various domains, from developing machine models in financial business to applying NLP techniques for customer engagement in e-commerce and food delivery companies.

Outside of works, I enjoy sharing insights through blogging and pushing my limits in marathon running. I actively attend community meet up and hackathon events and very excited to share my experiences and projects here on GitHub. Let's connect and collaborate!
